HANGMAN

 

1. You tell the player the length of the word they're going to guess.

2. You also tell them how many chances they get.

3. They guess letters, adn if they guess right, you tell them and tell them

   the location of that letter in the word. If wrong, Subtract one from their

   chances.

4. Keep going until they run out of chances or guess the word.

5. Note: They can't guess the same letter twice.

#Create a list of words.

#Give data (len of the word and #of chances)

#create chances

#create options

#check if letterguess finds a match

#if it does tell the user the location of the word

#else subtract 1 from chances

#remove the guessed letter from options

#if word is complete then show victory
